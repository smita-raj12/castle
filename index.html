    <h1>Giant sandcastles of this fabulous country!</h1>
    <p>World-record sandcastle built in Germany. The world's 
      tallest sandcastle has been built not on a beach but in the
      German industrial city of Duisburg, in the Ruhr region. 
      Towering 16.68m (54.5ft) high, it was sculpted by an 
      international team and shows famous landmarks, as its theme 
      is tourism.

      <p>The Guinness Book of World Records has more than a few 
         outlandish categories. There are, of course, the world's 
         largest bubble gum blown (20 inches), the most layers in a 
         sandwich (60), the longest beard (14 feet), and the world's 
         largest sandcastle, to name a few. And it's with this last 
         category that the world has a new reigning champion. Indeed, 
         the Guinness Book of World Records has recently crowned this 3,
         860-ton structure, rising some 55 feet in the air, as the world's 
         newly minted largest sandcastle.
         Perhaps even more impressive, the location of the world's 
         largest sandcastle is roughly 130 miles from the closest 
         beach in the landlocked city of Duisburg, Germany. 
         The 55-foot sandscaper, which was sculptured by a team of 
         designers from 10 countries over a three-week period, was 
         made to look like a medieval city. Visitors who look closely 
         at the sandcastle will recognize iconic architecture from 
         around the world, including the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
         Constructing the world's largest sandcastle is no easy feat. 
         In fact, this is the second year in which Duisburg attempted 
         
         to accomplish this record. Last year, a group attempted to 
         create the world's largest skyscraper, but failed as the 
         sandcastle collapsed during construction. Had they completed 
         it, they would have been disqualified from a the Guinness Book 
         of World Records for using materials other than just sand and water.
         In this year's attempt, the designers were able to complete 
         the structure (using water and a variety of different sand 
         types) even after their design suffered a small collapse. 
         The sandcastle will remain on view in Duisburg through 
         September 29.<br>
